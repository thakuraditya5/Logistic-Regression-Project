# Logistic-Regression-Project

Project of the Titanic : Machine Learning from Disaster Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

The project aims to build a machine learning model using Logistic Regression to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on features such as age, fare, class, gender, etc
Logistic Regression, a common model for binary classification, is applied here to predict survival on the Titanic based on multiple passenger features. The model performs reasonably well with around 81% accuracy, and future improvements might involve hyperparameter tuning or feature engineering.
